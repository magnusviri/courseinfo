You should have no problem with this entrance exam if you review the CD-Rom\/Booklet entitled Interactive Genetics. This review should include all of the problems on the pre-test. You can find the books on reserve at the campus libraries or you can check it out from the Program Office or buy it (ISBN 0-7380-1546-6) for $16.00 from Hayden-McNiel Publishing.
